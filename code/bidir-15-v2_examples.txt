since its founding , the eu has operated among an increasing plurality of national and globalising legal systems . this has meant both the european court of justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems . within the eu itself , the court of justice 's view is that if eu law conflicts with a provision of national law , then eu law has primacy . in the first major case in [41m[45m[32m[1m1964[0m[39m[49m[49m , costa v enel , a milanese lawyer , and former shareholder of an energy company , named mr costa refused to pay his electricity bill to enel , as a protest against the nationalisation of the italian energy corporations . he claimed the italian nationalisation law conflicted with the treaty of rome , and requested a reference be made to both the italian constitutional court and the court of justice under tfeu article 267 . the italian constitutional court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962 , and the treaty was in force from 1958 , costa had no claim . by contrast , the court of justice held that ultimately the treaty of rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation , and in any case under the treaty provisions only the commission could have brought a claim , not mr costa . however , in principle , mr costa was entitled to plead that the treaty conflicted with national law , and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision . the court of justice , repeating its view in van _gend_ en loos , said member states " albeit within limited spheres , have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves " on the " basis of reciprocity " . eu law would not " be overridden by domestic legal provisions , however framed ... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question . " this meant any " subsequent unilateral act " of the member state inapplicable . similarly , in _amministrazione_ delle _finanze_ v _simmenthal_ spa , a company , _simmenthal_ spa , claimed that a public health inspection fee under an italian law of 1970 for importing beef from france to italy was contrary to two regulations from 1964 and 1968 . in " accordance with the principle of the precedence of community law , " said the court of justice , the " directly applicable measures of the institutions " ( such as the regulations in the case ) " render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law " . this was necessary to prevent a " corresponding denial " of treaty " obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states " , that could " imperil the very foundations of the " eu . but despite the views of the court of justice , the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis .

there were many religions practiced during the yuan dynasty , such as buddhism , islam , and christianity . the establishment of the yuan dynasty had dramatically increased the number of muslims in china . however , unlike the western khanates , the yuan dynasty never converted to islam . instead , kublai khan , the founder of the yuan dynasty , favored buddhism , especially the tibetan variants . as a result , [32m[1mtibetan[0m[39m [32m[1mbuddhism[0m[39m was established as the de facto state religion . the top-level department and government agency known as the [45mbureau[49m of buddhist and tibetan affairs ( _xuanzheng_ [41myuan[49m ) was set up in _khanbaliq_ ( modern beijing ) to supervise buddhist monks throughout the empire . since kublai khan only esteemed the sakya sect of tibetan buddhism , other religions became less important . he and his successors kept a sakya imperial preceptor ( _dishi_ ) at court . before the end of the yuan dynasty , 14 leaders of the sakya sect had held the post of imperial preceptor , thereby enjoying special power . furthermore , mongol patronage of buddhism resulted in a number of monuments of buddhist art . mongolian buddhist translations , almost all from tibetan originals , began on a large scale after 1300 . many mongols of the upper class such as the jalayir and the _oronar_ nobles as well as the emperors also patronized confucian scholars and institutions . a considerable number of confucian and chinese historical works were translated into the mongolian language .

anti-inflammatory drugs are often used to control the effects of inflammation . glucocorticoids are the most powerful of these drugs ; however , these drugs can have many undesirable side effects , such as central obesity , hyperglycemia , osteoporosis , and their use must be tightly controlled . lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs are often used in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as [45mmethotrexate[49m or [41mazathioprine[49m . cytotoxic drugs inhibit the immune response by killing dividing cells such as activated t cells . however , the killing is indiscriminate and other constantly dividing cells and their organs are affected , which causes toxic side effects . immunosuppressive drugs such as [32m[1mcyclosporin[0m[39m prevent t cells from responding to signals correctly by inhibiting signal transduction pathways .

the free movement of workers regulation articles 1 to 7 set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers . first , articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment , conclude contracts , and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state . in a famous case , the belgian football association v bosman , a belgian footballer named jean-marc bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from _r.f.c_ . de liège to usl dunkerque when his contract finished , regardless of whether dunkerque could afford to pay liège the habitual transfer fees . the court of justice held " the transfer rules constitute [ d ] an obstacle to free movement " and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest , but this was unlikely . in groener v minister for education the court of justice accepted that a requirement to speak gaelic to teach in a dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the irish language , but only if the measure was not disproportionate . by contrast in _angonese_ v cassa di risparmio di bolzano spa a bank in bolzano , italy , was not allowed to require mr _angonese_ to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in bolzano . the court of justice , giving " horizontal " direct effect to tfeu article 45 , reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate , and because it was " impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means " , the measure was disproportionate . second , article 7 ( 2 ) requires equal treatment in respect of tax . in _finanzamt_ köln altstadt v _schumacker_ the court of justice held that it contravened tfeu art 45 to deny tax benefits ( e.g . for married couples , and social insurance expense deductions ) to a man who worked in germany , but was resident in belgium when other german residents got the benefits . by contrast in weigel v _finanzlandesdirektion_ für vorarlberg the court of justice rejected mr weigel 's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to austria violated his right to free movement . although the tax was " likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement " , because the charge applied equally to austrians , in absence of eu legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified . third , people must receive equal treatment regarding " social advantages " , although the court has approved residential qualifying periods . in [45m[32m[1mhendrix[0m[39m[49m [32m[1mv[0m[39m [32m[1memployee[0m[39m insurance institute the court of justice held that a dutch [41mnational[49m was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to belgium , because the benefit was " closely linked to the socio-economic situation " of the netherlands . conversely , in _geven_ v land nordrhein-westfalen the court of justice held that a dutch woman living in the netherlands , but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in germany , did not have a right to receive german child benefits , even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in germany but was resident in austria could . the general justifications for limiting free movement in tfeu article 45 ( 3 ) are " public policy , public security or public health " , and there is also a general exception in article 45 ( 4 ) for " employment in the public service " .

when rock units are placed under horizontal compression , they shorten and become thicker . because rock units , other than muds , do not significantly change in volume , this is accomplished in two primary ways : through faulting and folding . in the shallow crust , where brittle deformation can occur , thrust faults form , which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock . because deeper rock is often older , as noted by the principle of superposition , this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones . movement along faults can result in folding , either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along , forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault . deeper in the earth , rocks behave plastically , and fold instead of faulting . these folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards , creating " _antiforms_ " , or where it buckles downwards , creating " _synforms_ " . if the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards , they are called [45m[32m[1manticlines[0m[39m[49m [32m[1mand[0m[39m [32m[1m_synclines_[0m[39m , respectively . if some of the units in the fold are facing downward , the structure is called an overturned anticline or [41msyncline[49m , and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct _up-direction_ is unknown , they are simply called by the most general terms , _antiforms_ and _synforms_ .

for certain physical scenarios , it is impossible to model forces as being due to gradient of [41m[45mpotentials[49m[49m . this is often due to _macrophysical_ considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates . for example , [32m[1mfriction[0m[39m is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms , but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector . _nonconservative_ forces other than friction include other contact forces , tension , compression , and drag . however , for any sufficiently detailed description , all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials .

while the commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation , the european parliament and the council of the european union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process . according to the treaty on european union articles 9 and 10 , the eu observes " the principle of equality of its citizens " and is meant to be founded on " representative democracy " . in practice , equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the parliament can not initiate legislation against the commission 's wishes , citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in parliament as citizens of the largest countries , and " qualified majorities " or consensus of the council are required to legislate . the justification for this " democratic deficit " under the treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the european economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts , while popular understanding of the eu developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war . over time , this has meant the parliament gradually assumed more voice : from being an unelected assembly , to its first direct elections in [41m[45m[32m[1m1979[0m[39m[49m[49m , to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process . citizens ' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all european member states : under teu article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the commission with one million signatures . tfeu article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the parliament on issues which affect them . parliament elections , take place every five years , and votes for members of the european parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote . there are 750 meps and their numbers are " _degressively_ proportional " according to member state size . this means - although the council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states . meps divide , as they do in national parliaments , along political party lines : the conservative european people 's party is currently the largest , and the party of european socialists leads the opposition . parties do not receive public funds from the eu , as the court of justice held in parti _écologiste_ " les verts " v parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states . the parliament 's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an ombudsman pending any court proceedings . it can require the commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole commission ( as happened to the santer commission in 1999 ) . in some cases , the parliament has explicit consultation rights , which the commission must genuinely follow . however its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the commission and council , meaning power ( " _kratia_ " ) is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people ( " demos " ) : in the eu it is not yet true that " the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few .

the judicial branch of the eu has played an important role in the development of eu law , by assuming the task of interpreting the treaties , and accelerating economic and political integration . today the court of justice of the european union ( _cjeu_ ) is the main judicial body , within which there is a higher european court of justice ( commonly abbreviated as ecj ) that deals with cases that contain more public importance , and a general court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance . there is also a civil service tribunal to deal with eu staff issues , and then a separate court of auditors . under the treaty on european union article 19 ( 2 ) there is one judge from each member state , [41m[45m[32m[1m28[0m[39m[49m[49m at present , who are supposed to " possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices " ( or for the general court , the " ability required for appointment to high judicial office " ) . a president is elected by the judges for three years . under teu article 19 ( 3 ) is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of eu law . in fact , most eu law is applied by member state courts ( the english court of appeal , the german bundesgerichtshof , the belgian cour du travail , etc . ) but they can refer questions to the eu court for a preliminary ruling . the _cjeu_ 's duty is to " ensure that in the interpretation and application of the treaties the law is observed " , although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate . arguably this has been done through both seminal and controversial judgments , including van _gend_ en loos , mangold v helm , and kadi v commission .
